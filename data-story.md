## 📝 Executive Summary

Regional Community College aims to improve student satisfaction—measured through **professor evaluation scores**—while maintaining its commitment to **affordable education**.  
This data story analyzes enrollment patterns, student demographics, evaluation scores, and course costs to address the question:

**How can the college improve professor evaluations without increasing cost per course?**

After analyzing the dataset using Amazon QuickSight visualizations, Q&A, and scenarios, the findings suggest:

### 🎯 **Recommendation:**  
Selectively **increasing class sizes in high-performing humanities courses** is the most effective strategy to:

- Improve overall student satisfaction  
- Avoid increasing instructional costs  
- Leverage existing high student demand  
- Preserve (and potentially increase) evaluation outcomes  

This story walks through the evidence supporting this recommendation—from student demographics to course performance and cost structures.

## 👥 Current Student Landscape
Before deciding where improvements should be made, we examine who our students are and what programs they pursue.
`![Student Majors by Year](images/student_majors_by_year.png)`  

**Key Insights:**

- Enrollment in humanities-related majors is steady or increasing across academic years.  
- STEM and business majors show variability, with some years seeing dips in enrollment.  
- Stable demand in humanities courses suggests they can accommodate expansion without jeopardizing interest.

## Student Population Segmentation 
`![Proportion of Student Types](images/student_types_piechart.png)`  

**Observation:**

- Youth learners (under 30) represent a significant share of the student population.  
- Adult Continuing Education students also form a meaningful segment.  
- Both groups benefit from well-designed, engaging introductory humanities courses.

## ⭐ Where Course Satisfaction Is Strongest?
To understand where satisfaction is already strong, we analyze **EvaluationScore** by course.
`![Average EvaluationScore by Course](images/evalscore_by_course.png)`  

**Interpretation:**

- Several humanities courses consistently score at the **top end** of evaluation metrics.  
- These courses demonstrate strong instructional quality and student engagement.  
- They form the core candidates for targeted, data-driven expansion.

**Why this matters:**  
If a course is already performing extremely well, expanding class size is less likely to jeopardize quality—especially if pedagogical structure scales effectively.

## 💰 Can We Grow Without Paying More?

Improving satisfaction is only useful if it doesn't raise costs.
`![Average CostPerCourse by Course](images/cost_by_course.png)`  

**Key Findings:**

- High-evaluation humanities courses maintain **moderate cost-per-course levels**.  
- These courses are *not* among the most expensive offerings.  
- This means they deliver **strong satisfaction efficiently**—an ideal combination.

**Insight:**  
Courses that already provide high value at moderate cost can scale more easily without significant budget impact.

## 🎓 Why Focus on Humanities Class Sizes?

Bringing the visuals together:
### 1. **Enrollment & Demand**
- Student Major distribution shows steady interest in humanities.
- Class sizes can expand without risking low fill rates.

### 2. **High Evaluation Scores**
- Humanities courses dominate the top tier of evaluation scores.

### 3. **Cost Efficiency**
- Their cost structure is stable and moderate.

### 👉 Conclusion  
**Humanities courses provide the highest satisfaction at a cost that is already efficiently managed.**  
Scaling them offers the best return on effort for the college.

## 🧭 Recommendations
To implement this strategy effectively:

### **1. Identify Target Humanities Courses**
Use QuickSight filters to select courses that meet all criteria:
- Above-average evaluation scores  
- Median or below-median cost per course  
- Stable or increasing student demand  

### **2. Pilot Expanding Class Sizes**
- Add a reasonable number of seats to selected courses.  
- Monitor satisfaction scores and cost impacts closely.

### **3. Support Instructional Quality**
- Provide teaching assistants or peer leaders if class sizes increase.
- Offer faculty support for scaling their courses effectively.

### **4. Use Dashboards for Ongoing Monitoring**
Track:
- EvaluationScore trends  
- CostPerCourse shifts  
- Changes in student major distribution  
- Student Type impacts on satisfaction  

---

## ⚠️Risks, Assumptions & Next Steps

### **Assumptions**
- Increasing class size does not immediately lower course quality.  
- Cost per course remains stable within reasonable enrollment increases.  
- Student satisfaction is influenced by instruction and course design more than external factors.

### **Risks**
- Class size too large = diminished engagement  
- Humanities faculty may need additional support  
- Demand could shift unexpectedly year-to-year  

### **Next Steps**
- Run a **controlled pilot** for 1–2 terms.  
- Analyze satisfaction changes before scaling further.  
- Use Scenarios and Q&A to ask deeper questions like:  
  - *Do youth or adult students respond differently to larger classes?*  
  - *Do certain professors scale better than others?*  
  - *Which courses show the strongest correlation between class size and satisfaction?*

---

## ✅ Closing Statement

The analysis demonstrates that **increasing class sizes in high-performing humanities courses** is the most promising strategy to:

- Improve overall professor evaluations  
- Control or reduce per-student instructional costs  
- Align with the college’s mission of affordable, high-quality education  
- Leverage existing student demand efficiently  

This data-driven recommendation provides a clear, actionable path forward for Regional Community College.
