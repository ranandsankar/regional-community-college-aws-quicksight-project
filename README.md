# Regional Community College – AWS QuickSight Project

This repository contains all documentation for the AWS QuickSight project completed as part of the Regional Community College Student Enrollment Analysis initiative.

The project demonstrates:
- Dataset preparation in QuickSight  
- Creating visuals using Amazon Q  
- Publishing dashboards  
- Creating Q Topics and Named Entities  
- Building Scenarios  
- Generating a full Data Story using Q  
- Iterative BI analysis and storytelling  

📌 **NOTE:**  
Since Amazon QuickSight does not provide exportable files for dashboards/analyses/topics/scenarios, this repo contains **documentation + screenshots** rather than raw .qs resources.
