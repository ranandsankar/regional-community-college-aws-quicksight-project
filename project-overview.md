# Project Overview

### Objective
Regional Community College wants to understand and improve **student satisfaction**, especially around:

- Professor effectiveness  
- Course value  
- Academic experience

As a data analyst, I used **Amazon QuickSight** and **Amazon Q** to:

- Prepare the student enrollment dataset  
- Build analyses using natural language prompts  
- Create a Q Topic with named entities  
- Verify Q&A results  
- Publish an interactive Dashboard  
- Develop Scenarios to explore complex questions  
- Build a data story that communicates a strategic recommendation  

## My Final Thesis
**Increasing class sizes in high-performing humanities courses improves student satisfaction while minimizing additional course costs.**

This conclusion is supported using:

- Evaluation score analysis  
- Cost-per-course analysis  
- Student demographics  
- Course demand trends
